Installing Gromacs
==================

In this section we describe the process that we went through in order to get the molecular 
dynamics program **Gromacs** up and running on Mac **OS X**.

Please join our `Google groups community 
<http://groups.google.com/group/silicos-it-chemoinformatics>`_
to talk about inconsistencies, errors, raise questions or to make suggestions 
for improvement.


FFTW
----

As **Gromacs** is relying on the FFTW C subroutine library for computing discrete Fourier transforms, we 
need to have these installed. Download `FFTW 3.1.1 <http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.1.tar.gz>`_ and save
into the :file:`~/Downloads/` directory. Then unpack into the :file:`/usr/local/src` directory
and install::

    > cd /usr/local/src
    > tar -xvf ~/Downloads/fftw-3.3.1.tar.gz
    > cd fftw-3.3.1
    > ./configure --enable-threads --enable-float
    > make
    > sudo make install

This latter command asks for a root password that you should provide. This installation process installs
the FFTW header files in :file:`/usr/local/include` and the library files in :file:`/usr/local/lib`. 

CMake
-----

Download `cmake 2.8.6 <http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.6-Darwin64-universal.dmg>`_ 
and follow the installation instructions (make sure to install the command-line links). 
Check the installation::

	> which cmake
	/usr/bin/cmake
	> cmake --version
	cmake version 2.8.6
	
If you have **HomeBrew** installed, you could try this instead::

	> brew install cmake
	

Gromacs
-------

Download and unpack `gromacs 4.5.5 <ftp://ftp.gromacs.org/pub/gromacs/gromacs-4.5.5.tar.gz>`_.
In our case, we have downloaded into the :file:`~/Downloads` directory and are unpacking into 
the :file:`/usr/local/src/` directory::

	> cd /usr/local/src
	> tar -xvf ~/Downloads/gromacs-4.5.5.tar.gz
	> cd gromacs-4.5.5
	> mkdir build
	> cd build
	> cmake ..
	> make
	> sudo make install
	
.. highlight:: none

The latter command installs all **Gromacs**-related files in their respective directories::

> HTML-documentation:             /usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/html
> Topology and forcefield files:  /usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/top
> Include files:                  /usr/local/gromacs/include/gromacs
> Libraries:                      /usr/local/gromacs/lib
> Binaries:                       /usr/local/gromacs/bin

.. highlight:: console

The last thing to do is to set the paths correctly. This is done by appending the following
command to your :file:`~/.bash_profile` file::

	> echo "source /usr/local/gromacs/bin/GMXRC" >> ~/.bash_profile

In a new shell window, you can now test the installation::

	> mdrun -version
